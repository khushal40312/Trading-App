# Trading App Project - Day 25 Progress

## 🚀 Today's Achievements

Today I focused on building the user authentication system for my paper trading application. I've implemented the core user model and set up the basic authentication routes.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Created User Model**
   - Designed robust schema with validation
   - Implemented secure password handling with bcrypt
   - Added JWT token generation methods
   - Set up paper trading balance functionality
   - Created user settings and role management

2. **Set Up Authentication Routes**
   - User registration with validation
   - User login with secure password comparison
   - Logout functionality
   - User profile retrieval

3. **Implemented Authentication Middleware**
   - JWT token verification
   - Route protection for authenticated users

### 💻 Code Highlights

#### User Schema

The user schema includes:
- Structured name fields with validation
- Email validation using regex
- Secure password handling (hashing and select: false)
- Starting paper trading balance
- Portfolio and trades references
- User settings and theme preferences
- Role-based authorization
- Refresh token support

#### Authentication Methods

- `generateAuthToken()`: Creates a JWT for user authentication
- `comparePassword()`: Securely compares hashed passwords
- `hashPassword()`: Static method to hash passwords on registration

#### Routes

Implemented routes with validation:
- POST `/register`: Create new user account
- POST `/login`: Authenticate and receive token
- GET `/logout`: Invalidate current token
- GET `/profile`: Retrieve authenticated user profile

### 🔍 API Validation

Used express-validator to enforce:
- Valid email format
- Minimum name length (3 characters)
- Minimum password length (6 characters)

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining User Routes**
   - Profile update functionality
   - Balance management
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - User settings management

2. **Portfolio Management**
   - Create portfolio model
   - Implement stock purchase/selling
   - Portfolio performance tracking

3. **Trade System**
   - Trade execution
   - Trade history
   - Performance analytics

4. **Front-end Development**
   - Create user authentication UI
   - Dashboard with portfolio overview
   - Trading interface

### 📊 Progress Overview

- ✅ Basic project structure: 100%
- ✅ User authentication system: 60%
- ⬜ Portfolio management: 0%
- ⬜ Trading system: 0%
- ⬜ Frontend development: 0%

## 💡 Learnings & Challenges

Today I gained experience with:
- Implementing secure password handling with bcrypt
- Setting up JWT-based authentication flow
- Creating MongoDB schemas with proper validation
- Building a modular Express.js application structure

Main challenge was designing a scalable user model that can accommodate future features while maintaining security best practices.

Looking forward to continuing development tomorrow with focus on completing the user management system and starting on the portfolio features!
